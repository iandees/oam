Access Tools
++++++++++++

In general, the area of OAM that has the most room for experimentation is
access tools, or other tools for building products out of the Imagery Index.

Source Control
--------------

In order to foster community development, we are using Git for our version
control system. Specifically, at this time, we are using github as the main
repository for OpenAerialMap.

The Git repository is currently available from:

  http://github.com/oam/oam/

Anyone who is interested can issue a pull request through Github. 

Adding an Application
---------------------

When creating an application, you should: 
* Come up with a name for your project
* Create a README.txt describing the project, in the following format::

   Name: Project Name
   Description: Project description here.
   URL: http://example.com/oamproject/
   License: Public Domain


* This README.txt file will be read by the application catalog and made
  available. Note: there is no application catalog yet.
